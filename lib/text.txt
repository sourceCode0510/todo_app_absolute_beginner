let's create a simple todo app

1) we will create the backened first.
    - before doing that let's run our default code.
    - let's create our todo model. it will be the blueprint of our todo.
    - with that our todo model is complete.
    - now let's create our database model and it's functions to insert, delete data.
    - to use the database we need to import some packages to our project.
    - a) sqflite, b) path
    - execute the command 'flutter pub add sqflite' and 'flutter pub add path' in terminal
    - now let's create our database model.
    - now with that our database model is complete.
    - now let's remove all the default code in main.dart and start from scratch.
    - now let's add some dummie data to our database.
    - import our models to main.dart
    - create an object of database connect in our main.dart
    - insert a sample todo in database and try to print it on console.
    - now let's reinstall the app so everything is ready.
    - we can see our sample todo in console.
    - now that it works. let's create the UI widgets and functionalities.

2) before we begin 
    - at the time of recording this video the latest version of flutter is 2.5.1
    - it has a habit of yelling at us for not using 'const' keyword before the constant widgets.
    - so ignore the warnings and follow along. we will fix the warnings in the end.

    - I will create our homepage in a separate file.
    - we will create some widgets for the UI
        - Userinput (where user will input the todo)
        - Todocard (the todo blueprint for visual, checkbox and title stuff)
        - todolist (it will contain the todocards)
    - let's start
    - add it to our homepage to see how it looks.
    - let's do some modifying.
    - let's create the todocard.
    - add it to our homepage to see what's going on .
    - now let's create our todolist. that will show data from our database.
    - now let's add it to our homepage.
    - remove the constant values from todocard.
    - that's our sample data we saved in our database before.
    - now we have to add functions for adding from userinput.
    - now we have to pass functions to both widgets. (todolist, Userinput)
    - the 'insertFunction(myTodo)' will lifted up and activate the 'addItem(Todo todo)' function.
    - now it's working but, we have to add delete functions as well.
    - the delete button is on todocard. so we have to lift the function of deletebutton to homepage where our functions are.
        function will be passed down like this -
        homepage -> todolist -> todocard
    -   now our todolist have access to the addItem and deleteItem functions. now we can pass them to the todocard.
    - but now todocard should tell the addItem and deleteItem functions that what does it want to change.
    - now let's see it it works.
    - now let's remove the sample data code from main.dart
    - let's fix the warnings.
    - with that we have a simple working todo app.

    - that date doesn't look good. let's format that.
    - to do that we have to add another package to our project. -> intl
    - type 'flutter pub add intl' in terminal
    - format that in where we show our data -> Todocard.
    - looks good I think.

    - I want to modify some things.

    - alright that's it people. thanks for watching.
